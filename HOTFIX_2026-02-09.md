# Hotfix - February 9, 2026

## Fixed Issues

### 1. .env File Not Loading in `openclaw start` Command

**Problem**: The `openclaw start` command was checking for API keys before loading the `.env` file, causing "No LLM API key found" error even when keys were configured in `.env`.

**Solution**: Added `load_dotenv()` call before environment variable checks in `openclaw/cli/main.py`.

**Files Changed**:
- `openclaw/cli/main.py`: Added .env loading at start of `start()` command

**Impact**: Users can now use `.env` file without running `openclaw onboard` first.

### 2. Import Error in Start Command

**Problem**: The `start` command was trying to import `start_gateway_with_telegram` which is in the scripts directory, not a proper module.

**Solution**: Changed to directly use `create_and_start_gateway()` from bootstrap module.

**Files Changed**:
- `openclaw/cli/main.py`: Fixed import to use bootstrap function

### 3. README Tone Adjustment

**Problem**: README was too promotional, needed more practical Python-focused tone.

**Solution**: Updated introduction to emphasize this as a practical Python implementation, with more modest language.

**Files Changed**:
- `README.md`: Updated title and introduction

## Testing

```bash
# Should now work with just .env file (no onboard needed)
cd openclaw-python
echo "GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-key" > .env
echo "TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-token" >> .env
uv run openclaw start
```

## What Users Need to Do

**Nothing!** These fixes are backward compatible. If you have API keys in `.env`, just run:

```bash
uv run openclaw start
```

Or continue using:

```bash
openclaw onboard  # Interactive setup
openclaw gateway run  # Gateway with web UI
```
